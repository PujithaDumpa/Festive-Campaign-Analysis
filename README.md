## Project Overview 
Festive seasons significantly influence sales performance in the retail industry, and promotional campaigns play a key role in driving customer purchases during these periods.This project evaluates the effectiveness of festive promotional campaigns using sales data, focusing on how promotion types, product categories, and regions impact incremental revenue and sales uplift. By analyzing key performance metrics, the project provides insights that support data-driven decision-making for future festive campaigns.

## Business Problem
